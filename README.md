# Under development

ReactJS RF tools projects that I'm working on, the idea is to add basic functionalities to calculate parameters, plots and other typical tools used in microwave engineering.

 - Phased arrays functionalities:
   - Plot 2D polar plot
   - Variable number of elements
   - Editable parameters: amplitude, phase and position
 
 ## Roadmap
 
 - Phased array polar plot gain labels
 - Phased array elements position grid
 - Add distributed elements calculator
